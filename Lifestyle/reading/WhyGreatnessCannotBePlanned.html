      <h2>When Critics Miss the Point: Purpose Is Not the Point</h2>
      <p>I've seen many articles that disagree with this idea. Even so, many haven't grasped the main point properly. For example, some articles argue that "purpose is useful" or "we must have a purpose," often citing Elon Musk building rockets with a clear purpose as an example. Let's not debate whether Elon Musk has every purpose crystal clear—let's assume he does. But Elon Musk is just one entrepreneur making use of his own system. There are many systems, just as the author has one that is very different from what people think Elon’s is. And Elon Musk is already overly prominent on social media. Using such an example is risky because it can make one seem like an unsophisticated reader, which undermines the persuasiveness of judging such a bold theory.
        <br><br>
        The main idea of this book is never that "purpose is not important." The book praises purpose about three times, in the beginning-to-middle chapters and again in the last few, because we achieve engineerable things through purpose. Unfortunately, almost all of the greatest things aren’t engineerable (though the limited number of examples the book lists is arguable). That’s why we need a more novel method—and that’s the spirit of this book. Even though I think this book doesn’t prove the theory will work (the most detailed examples are always image breeding or an algorithm helping a ball find the door, which are only a few proofs), you can’t ignore that the book identifies a really important issue—be cautious about the false compass, which is usually one’s wrong purpose.
        <br><br>
        I also admire how gutsy the book is. It’s hard to prove because it has fewer pieces of evidence than those who stand by the purpose theory. But being hard to prove doesn’t make it any less great. It’s very inspirational, especially for those who want to create something with their passion.

        <h2>Who Gets to Dream? The Conditions Behind the Theory</h2>
        <p>The fact is that the author was at the University of Central Florida when they crafted the book—a time and place where they could dream and take advantage of their freedom. Later, they entered OpenAI, which was (and still is) a place where researchers don’t have to worry too much about short-term goals (hey, consider how they’re financed).
          <br><br>
          If someone is living a busy life with constant short-term livelihood concerns, they might consider this book to be nothing but empty talk. But hey—they’re the authors. There are always people who have the conditions to benefit from this kind of theory.
