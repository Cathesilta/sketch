      <h2>Retrospective on "Poor Dad Rich Dad"</h2>
      <p>It’s been three years since I was first inspired by this book. Since then, I’ve explored the world of entrepreneurship and investment through small experiments—trying to understand the meaning behind every “golden sentence” it offered. Now, I’m going to write down the lessons I’ve learned—especially those I didn’t fully grasp when I first read it. 
        <br><br>
        The Rich Don’t Work for Money.
        <br><br>
        Back when I first read this idea, I didn’t understand how money flows in the world—and that’s why I couldn’t see how someone could earn money without working. I still haven’t had the chance to be part of a business that runs without the direct effort of everyone involved, but I’ve gained a clearer sense of it through exploring other ideas—especially The E-Myth by Michael Gerber, smart contract systems, and the way capital interacts with business.
        <br><br>
        One thing they all share is this: the rich own systems. Many self-employed people believe they’re entrepreneurs, but they often fall into a trap—they still work for money. Even if they make more than employees (because they control the cash flow in their business), they’re still exchanging time for earned income.
        <br><br>
        But “the rich don’t work for money” points to something else: a system that runs without the owner trading time for income. That system might be a business where people and money move through its structure. It could be a company. It could be a “playground” like the hotel story in The E-Myth, or Valve, or even a blockchain—places where people contribute because they enjoy what they do. (Yes, they’re working, but not the system’s creator or investor—not in the usual sense.) It could even be a country, designed to sustain itself and help its people thrive. In all these cases, the owner or investor doesn’t work for money—they’ve built something that works with or through money.
        <br><br>
        That’s what I’ve been trying to understand—how to become someone who builds or owns such a system.
        <br><br>
        The Rich Invent Money.
        <br><br>
        How can money be invented? One must understand money very well until he can say he understand this sentence. I still cannot, but it gets clearer as I was thinking about "what is money", "why do human beings need that", and "what if humans never have had money" in 2024 all the time.
